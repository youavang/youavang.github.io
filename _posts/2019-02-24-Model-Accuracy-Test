Eight different machine learning models are trained on the same data. The data consist of different writings of numbers from 0 to 9. Each model will be tested on how well they can predict the number. The machine learning models being tested are:
  1. logistic regression
  2. svm with linear kernel
  3. svm with poly kernel
  4. svm with rbf kernel
  5. k-NN
  6. naive bayes
  7. decision tree classification
  8. random forest classification

Start by importing the required libraries and download the data:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
```
Next, create a dataframe, then split the dataset into training (75%) and testing set and normalize the features.
```python
df = load_digits()
X = df.data
y = df.target

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc_X = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc_X.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc_X.transform(X_test)
```
Now train each model and calculate their accuracy.

For svm poly kernel model, train with different value of degree via a loop to find the kernel with the best accuracy. Plot the graph and anaylize the trend.

For k-NN model, train with different value of k via a loop to find which k result in the best accuracy. Plot the graph and anaylize the trend.

For random forest model, also train with different values of n-estimators via a loop to find the estimator with the best accuracy. Plot the graph and anaylize the trend.

Here are the best accuracy for each models:
  1. Logistic Regression = 0.9622222222222222
  2. SVM with linear kernel = 0.9733333333333334
  3. SVM with poly kernel = 0.9822222222222222
  4. SVM with rbf kernerl = 0.9844444444444445
  5. k-NN = 0.9733333333333334
  6. Naive Bayes = 0.7733333333333333
  7. Decision Tree Classification = 0.8488888888888889
  8.  Random Forest Classification = 0.9822222222222222
  
When comparing the accuracy scores of all the models, SVM with rbf kernel produced the highest accuracy score for this dataset.
